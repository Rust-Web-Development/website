<h1>Rust Web Development</h1>

Checkout why you want to use Rust for web development via this [blog article](https://rustwebdevelopment.com/blog/why-rust/) on this website. And of course there is the [Rust Web Development book](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-web-development).

You can use the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) to exercise little code snippets and follow along tutorials. The website [AreWeWebYet](https://www.arewewebyet.org/) has crates, tutorials and books you need to get started.
